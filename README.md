# Anomaly_detection_on_credit_card_Data

Predicted if transaction is fraud or normal on credit card data of 283K transactions using anomaly
detection algorithms like isolated forest, LOF, KNN resulted in precision of 0.9.

Also applied other classification algorithms like Decision tree classifier,Logistic Regression,RandomForestClassifier,AdaBoostClassifier,XGBoost Classifier.

# Flight_Fare_Prediction
Performed data preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis, feature engineering and Data Visualization.

Exercised regression alogorithms like RandomForestRegressor,LinearRegression. 

Used RandomizedSearchCV on RandomForestRegressor with cross validation which gave r2 score of 0.82.

# Churn_Prediction_on_Imbanced_Data

Performed Churn Prediction on Telco_Customer Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn

Dataset was imbalanced so performed Undersampling, Oversampling and SMOTE techniques. Smote results in better accuracy.
